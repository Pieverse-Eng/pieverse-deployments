## Features

- On-chain Daily Beats proofs (privacy-preserving): Batch each dayâ€™s completions into a deterministic hash root and publish to BNB Chain. Titles/details stay off-chain; proofs are verifiable on-chain.
- Gas sponsorship via MegaFuel: Eligible users receive 1 sponsored upload per day; sponsored txs are sent with gasPrice=0. Automatically falls back to a normal transaction if not sponsorable.
- Smart-contract Time Challenges: Create, join, and finalize personal/prediction/commit challenges on BNB Chain with ERC-20 staking and on-chain state tracking.
  Earn points and unlock badges on successful on-chain uploads and challenge milestones; backend confirms and records rewards.
- Multi-chain and wallet integration: Built for BNB Smart Chain (Mainnet) and opBNB Testnet with Particle ConnectKit wallet support and gas-optimized defaults for BSC.
